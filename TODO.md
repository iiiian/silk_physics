# how to impress

- Best FOSS blender bloth sim plugins

# Next step

- [ ] integrate tight inclusion benchmark/testing -> ccd works correct and efficiently

# Roadmap

## Tier 1

- [x] spatial hashing collision detection (native grouping)
- [x] eigen subspace + iterative solve
- [] blender integration with easy to use gui
- [] cuda solver
- [] install blas and lapack automatically

## Tier 2

- [] store upper triangle only for symmetric lhs
- [] real collision culling based in IPC
- [] auto stiffness tuning
- [] subspace conditioning
- [] initial curvature
